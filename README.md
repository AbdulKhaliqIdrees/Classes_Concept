Day 1: Learning Python Classes
Overview
Day 1 was dedicated to understanding the fundamental concepts of classes in Python. This included grasping the concept of classes and objects, along with various associated methods and variables.
Topics Covered
Class in Python
Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, defining attributes and methods.
How to Create a Class
Classes are created using the class keyword followed by the class name in CamelCase.
Rules to Create a Class
Class names follow CamelCase and the class definition starts with the class keyword.
Object
Objects are instances of classes, created by invoking the class.
How to Create an Object
Objects are created by calling the class.
Formal Arguments
Formal arguments are parameters in class methods, essential for passing data to objects.
Accessing Class Members using Object
Class members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.
Using Local Variables
Local variables are defined within methods and are accessible only within those methods.
Constructor in Python
The __init__ method acts as the constructor, initializing instance variables upon object creation.
Instance Variable and Instance Method
Instance variables and methods are tied to specific instances, enabling unique state and behavior per object.
Class Variable and Class Method
Class variables and methods are shared among all instances, defined with the @classmethod decorator.
Concept of Namespace
Namespaces ensure unique identification, mapping names to objects.
Getter and Mutator Method
Getter methods retrieve object attributes, while mutator methods modify them, ensuring encapsulation.
Static Method
Static methods don't access or modify class state, useful for utility functions. Defined with @staticmethod.
